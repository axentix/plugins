# Plugins

## Plugin definition

A plugin can entirely be created from scratch, or imported and adaptated from an open-source component already existing. 

You can find the plugin list on :  
https://useaxentix.com/docs/plugins

All the validated plugins are verified by the Axentix Team.

The plugins are adapted to the Axentix syntax to make it easier for you to use them.
## Install

Every validated plugin will be published on NPM.

To install any of them, use 
```sh
npm install @axentix/plugin-{pluginName}
```

Every plugin will come out with a README to make it easier for you to understand what they are made for and how to use them.
